  <h1 class="p3">About Backsies</h1>
  <p class="p2"> In the winter of 2023 a game was created by Tripoint games. It was a card drawing, dice rolling game called Backsies. The game went through many different variations until the game had its core gameplay finished. The game would conist of player trying to reach the end of the board to win the game, but in order to move you would have to roll a die. The die consist of a X, a Y, a Z, and 3 backs. If you get a X you will be able to go forward 1 space, for Z you will be able to move forward 1 or 2 spaces, for Y you get to draw a card, and back will move you back 1 space.
