  <h1 class="p3">About Backsies</h1>
  <p class="p2">
    Backsies is a board game first made at the end of 2023. Since then, it has been expanded and is being worked on to eventually become a full game. In the game, you will roll dice, draw cards, go backwards, and go to the negative zone (more about that in the rules). The game was made by the Tripoint crew (literally 3 teenagers) and other people who helped contribute to the game.
  </p>

  <h1 class="p3">How to Play Backsies</h1>
  <p class="p2">
    The rules:<br>
    The rules to Backsies are simple: When it is your turn, you roll the die. Getting a back moves you back 1 space, X moves you forward one, Z lets you move forward 1 or 2 spaces, and Y makes you draw a card. If you go forward onto a card space, you draw a card; you don't draw if you go back onto a card space. If you go forward or back onto a jump space, you go to the attached jump space. If you go forward onto a back, you go to the attached back, but if you go back onto a back, you can stay on it. If you get a second back, you go up to the back.
  </p>
  <p class="p2">
    Negative Zone:<br>
    The Negative Zone is a place you go when you draw a card that sends you there. When it is your turn in the Negative Zone, you will roll the dice. If you get an X, Y, or Z, you get out of the Negative Zone and are placed on the jump space closest to the most people. But if you get a back, you draw a Frontsies card, and you will go back a space and draw a Frontsies card.
  </p>
  <p class="p4">
    The Void:<br>
    When you go back 5 times in the Negative Zone, you will enter the Void. The Void makes you draw a negative trait card, and you will go back to the back space closest to the most number of players.
  </p>
