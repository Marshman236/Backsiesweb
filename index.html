<h1 style="text-align: center;" class="p3" >About Backsies</h1>
<p  class="p2">Backsies is a board game first made at the end of 2023. Since then it has been expanded and is being worked on to eventually become a full game. In the game you will roll dice, draw cards, go backwards, and go to the negative zone (more about that in the rules).The game was made by the Tripoint crew (literally 3 teenagers) and other people who helped contribute to the game. </p>

The rules to backsies are simple: when it is your turn you roll the die;  getting a back moves you back 1 space, x moves you forward one, Z Lets You Move forward 1 or 2 Spaces, and Y makes you draw a card. If you go forward onto a card Space You draw a card, you don't draw if You go back onto a  card Space.
 If you go forward or back onto a Jump space you go to the attached Jump space. If You go forward onto a back you go to the attached back ; but if you go back onto a back You can stay on it, and if You get a second back you go up to the back.
